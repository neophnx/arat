Logging in

Many functions in arat, such as adding and changing annotations, can only be performed by users who are LOGGED IN.

User and password management is handled by the administrator of your arat installation. The remainder of this tutorial assumes that you have a username and password. If you do not have one already, this would be a good time to ask your arat installation administrator for this information.

Try logging in and out now, and make sure you are logged in before proceeding with the tutorial.




Troubleshooting

Some documents in this tutorial have a "troubleshooting" section like this at the bottom. These sections provide help for resolving possible issues following the instructions in the document. Feel free to skip over these sections unless you are having trouble with some of the instructions.

* If the login fails to take effect, you may be blocking cookies. arat uses a cookie to detect if users are logged in, and you should allow this cookie to be set to use arat for annotation.

* If you are administering the arat installation and don't know where to set usernames and passwords: edit the file config.py in the arat installation root using a text editor.
